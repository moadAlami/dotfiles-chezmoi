# This option allows you to filter the types of tasks synced. To this end, the
# value of this option should be a comma-separated list of item types, where
# each item type is either "event", "apt", "recur-event", "recur-apt", "todo",
# "recur" or "cal". Note that the comma-separated list must not contain any
# spaces. Refer to the documentation of the --filter-type command line argument
# of calcurse for more details. Set this option to "cal" if the configured
# CalDAV server doesn't support tasks, such as is the case with Google
# Calendar.
